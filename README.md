## Documentation

[Sage Documentation][sage]

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install sage
```

## Experimental Browser Support

`sage.js` and `sage.min.js` are the browser and minified browser versions of
the library. Modern browsers are generally supported, but not widely tested.
The `test/index.html` and `test/index-min.html` run the [mocha][mocha] tests
in the browser.

Security restrictions on cross-domain requests currently limits the usefulness
of the browser version. Using a local proxy or configuring [Cross-Origin
Resource Sharing][cors] on a proxy in front of ElasticSearch may allow you to
use the library in the browser.

## Philosophy

The philosophy of *sage* is to provide a thin wrapper around the ElasticSearch
API, making the search engine easier to use from JavaScript. *sage* is
designed to quickly allow you to get started with ElasticSearch. As you get
more comfortable with *sage* and Elasticsearch, *sage* gives you full access
to ElasticSearch's more advanced features.

The library API generally follows the RESTful API, so you can use the
ElasticSearch docs as well as the *sage* docs to build your applications. If a
feature is missing from *sage* or you need to access more advanced features,
the `request` method allows you to send custom requests directly to
ElasticSearch.
